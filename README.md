## Book Description
Data analysis has become an essential skill in a variety of domains where knowing how to work with data and extract insights can generate significant value.

*Hands-On Data Analysis with Pandas* will show you how to analyze your data, get started with machine learning, and work effectively with Python libraries often used for data science, such as pandas, NumPy, matplotlib, seaborn, and scikit-learn. Using real-world datasets, you will learn how to use the powerful pandas library to perform data wrangling to reshape, clean, and aggregate your data. Then, you will learn how to conduct exploratory data analysis by calculating summary statistics and visualizing the data to find patterns. In the concluding chapters, you will explore some applications of anomaly detection, regression, clustering, and classification, using scikit-learn, to make predictions based on past data.

By the end of this book, you will be equipped with the skills you need to use pandas to ensure the veracity of your data, visualize it for effective decision-making, and reliably reproduce analysis across multiple domains.

## Notes on Environment Setup
Environment setup instructions are in the chapter 1 of the text. If you don't have the book, you must install Python 3.6 or higher, [set up a virtual environment](https://packaging.python.org/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/#creating-a-virtual-environment), [activate it](https://packaging.python.org/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/#activating-a-virtual-environment), and then [install the packages listed in requirements.txt](https://packaging.python.org/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/#using-requirements-files). You can then launch JupyterLab and use the ch_01/checking_your_setup.ipynb Jupyter notebook to check your setup. Consult [this resource](https://anbasile.github.io/programming/2017/06/25/jupyter-venv/) if you have issues with using your virtual environment in Jupyter.

## Solutions
Each chapter comes with exercises. The solutions for chapters 1-11 can be found [here](https://github.com/stefmolin/Hands-On-Data-Analysis-with-Pandas/tree/master/solutions).
